# Kinetics datasets

Kinetics is a collection of large-scale, high-quality datasets of URL links of up to 650,000 video clips that cover 400/600/700 human action classes, depending on the dataset version. The videos include human-object interactions such as playing instruments, as well as human-human interactions such as shaking hands and hugging. Each action class has at least 400/600/700 video clips. Each clip is human annotated with a single action class and lasts around 10 seconds.

The Kinetics project publications can be found here: https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics.

# Download Videos


CVDF currently hosts the videos in the Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-700-2020 datasets.

### Kinetics-400

The train/val/test splits are subdivided into many files. The lists of links to video files can be found here:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/train/k400_train_path.txt

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/val/k400_val_path.txt

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/test/k400_test_path.txt

It is easy to obtain a specific split (e.g. train), by:
```
bash download.sh k400_train_path.txt
```
Then, extract `*.tar.gz` files by:
```
bash extract.sh k400_train_path.txt
```

The links/annotations can be found under the annotation subfolders:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/annotations/train.csv

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/annotations/val.csv

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/annotations/test.csv

# Downstream annotations

We also host annotations for AVA-Kinetics and Countix, which both use Kinetics-700 videos. 

To download annotations for AVA-Kinetics:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/700_2020/annotations/ava_kinetics_v1_0.tar.gz

To download annotations for countix:
